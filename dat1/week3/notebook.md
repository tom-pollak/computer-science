# DATA 1 Practical 2 - Questions

Simos Gerasimou


## Classic Cars & Co

Classic Cars & Co is a UK company that has a large collection of classic cars from the 1980s. 

DataVision (the company you are working as a Data Scientist) has been contracted to analyse the data available for the cars and provide insights by analysing the different characteristics of the cars (e.g., speed, price). 

This Jupyter Notebook will be presented to the Classic Cars & Co main stakeholders who have limited knowledge about data science. So, your findings should be complemented by a suitable justification explaining what you observe and, when applicable, what does this observation mean and, possibly, why it occurs. The analysis along with the explanation will help them to understand whether they need to invest more to expand their collection.

### **Important Information**

(1) To answer these exercises, you **must first read Chapter 2: Introduction to NumPy from the Python Data Science Handbook** (https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html)


(2) For each question (task) a description is provided accompanied (most of the time) by two cells: one for writing the Python code and another for providing the justification. Feel free to add more cells if you feel they are needed, but keep the cells corresponding to the same question close by.

**Hint 1**: If you find difficulties in solving a task, look at Chapter 2 from the Python Data Science Handbook.

**Hint 2**: Solving each task using NumPy should require less than 10 lines of code

#### **T1) Explore the dataset and for each column write its name, data type (categorical/numerical - nominal,ordinal,discrete,continuous) and its meaning (i.e., what does it capture?)**

* You may want to open the CSV file using a text editor (e.g., Notepad) or a spreadsheet editor (e.g., Excel)
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region id="cIkkf9Hi_XQb" -->
**Write your answer here (the first is given)**
* Make: Categorical (Nominal) - The model of the car
* ....

### 1) Reading dataset

The classic cars dataset is available on VLE (look for classicCars.csv in the Practicals section)
<!-- #endregion -->

```python id="PMju2Rd-nb6R"
#Using NumPy to read the dataset
import numpy as np
#Define the path to the dataset
data_path = "ClassicCars.csv"
#Define the type of each dataset column. 
#This is needed because NumPy arrays cannot directly read files with different data types
#Hence, we are using Structured arrays. 
#But, we will soon move to Pandas which makes data manipulation easier
types = ['U20', 'U10', 'U5', 'U20', 'U3', 'f4', 'f4', 'f4', 'f4', 'U10', 'i4', 'i4', 'i4', 'i4', 'i4']
#Read the dataset
data = np.genfromtxt(data_path, dtype=types, delimiter=',', names=True)
```

<!-- #region id="2iEJBv9kdIiI" -->
**Structured Arrays**
